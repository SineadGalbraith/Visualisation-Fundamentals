# Assignment 1.3

All three required features have been displayed in this visualisation. One key difference between the original visualisation and this one is the addition of the Temperature graph onto the same graph as the other information. In this visualisation, Temperature has been plotted as a third axis (the right hand side of the Y-axis).

Encodings used within this assignment include:
- Position: This encoding channel represents the towns and cities along the journey.
- Colour: Seven line colours in total have been used to differentiate between the pieces of information. The Key shows more details on the line colours and the information they represent.
- Weight/Thickness: This encoding channel displays the Number of Survivors along the journey to and from.
