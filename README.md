# Visualisation Fundamentals

This repo contains the code for Assignments 1.2 and 1.3 of the CS7DS4 Data Visualisation Module @ TCD.

All of the visualisations were made using p5.js.

## Assignment 1.2

The objective of this assignment was to compare different encoding channels by visualising the dataset "Number of people aged 15+ with no education (in millions) by continent".

The three attributes for this assignment were "Year" (ordinal), "Entity/Continent" (categorical) and "Total number of people..." (quantitative).

Requirements for this assignment included:
- Plot at least 5 encodings of the "Continent" attribute.
- Plot at least 5 quantitative encodings for the "Total number of people..." attribute.
- At least 4 charts should feature all three attributes.

## Assignment 1.3

The objective of this assignment was to recreate Minard's visualisation of Napolean's Russian Campaign. The dataset for this assignment included three separate tables showing:
- Longitude, Latitude and City Names.
- Longitude, Temperature and Dates (of the march home only).
- Longitude, Latitude, Number of Survivors, Direction of Travel (A = towards attack/R = return journey), Army Divisions.

A number of features must be shown in this assignment:
- The position of the cities and paths of the army through them.
- Survivors in the army along the path.
- Temperature during retreat.
